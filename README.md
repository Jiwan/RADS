OpenRADS
====
An open source Riot Application Distribution System library linking project.
All missing data and linking informations were recovered by reverse engineering to permit a linking to the dynamic library rads.dll .

Usage :
You must compile the project RADS with VC++ (v100 or v110)and link your project to it using headers, the fake .lib and the .dll.
After being done with the compilation, you must replace fake rads.dll with the real one provide in League Of Legends client or the one in the Reverse folder.


I do not guarantee a safe usage of this library.
